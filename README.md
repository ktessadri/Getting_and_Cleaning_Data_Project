Overview

This project takes a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and cleans it.

Repo for the project -

You have to get the data and then load it onto your machine. You can then load it into R.

An R script (run_analysis.R) is then used to
  1. Combine the training and the test sets. 
  2. Seperate teh measurements on the mean and the standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3. Put descriptive labels in the data set 
  4. Create a new, tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Additional information about the variables and data is in the CodeBook.MD file.
